### Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces

My objective with this repository is to build three fundamental components of an operating system functionality 
- Virtualization
- Concurrency
- File System


#### Limitations
1. Note that this is a very simplified model of an operating system, 
thus the components are not designed to be fully functional in any sense of it (fully or partial). 
It would however simulate how an operating system functions based on these three components.

2. Scalability: This program may not scale well to large numbers of processes or memory-intensive applications due to its basic design.
3. Security: This program may not include robust security measures found in modern operating systems
4. Performance: Since this is a simplified model, performance optimization is not one of my main goals. 
It may come as an after-thought though

#### Organization
Each component has a README markdown file that contains information regarding
1. Design considerations
2. Time-space tradeoffs
3. Constraints
4. Simulation environment
